This is something that I created during down time at one of my earlier jobs, it's also not as complete as I'd like. My team used Jira for task management and I was in charge of leading an automated testing drive. To make things more interesting, I hooked up a really basic RPG to Jira, so that you gain experience as you progress on tickets. Some things that I would/should complete given time: some sort of identity management. People were able to game the system by making other people fight each other, and it leads to more interesting things with custom leveling, shops, etc. Also security. It was developed on a completely secure internal network, so I prioritized getting core functionality out over protecting the RESTful server. It's currently vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks. I have it set to use localhost as a server. It was an interesting project, and my knowledge of the jira-python interface proved invaluable when I had to create over a hundred practically identical tickets (for good reason) shortly after creating it.
