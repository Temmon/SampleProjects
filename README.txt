These are a few projects I've worked on for fun, for my own personal interest. All the folders have a readme of their own with a description for them. 

These are all written in Python, because it's the quickest and easiest to just get started writing something with, which is a major priority for me when I'm for-fun programming. I'd rather use a compiled language in general for anything I had to maintain.
